The majority of travel products do not need to be grounded and 99% of travel adapters are not grounded. After comparing all the pro’s and con’s, we decided not to use grounding. Because of the decision, it is not recommended to use high-power grounded appliances with this device. Doing so may cause damage to the GloboCharge and your appliance.<\/p>"
